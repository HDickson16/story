	<h2>The Capulets and Montagues</h2>
	<p>
	Long ago there were two families, the Capulets and Montagues.<br>
For many generations they have never once agreed with one another. Often brawls and fights occurred between the two families. From these families two specific souls were before them.<br>
From the Capulets, Juliet.<br>
From the Montagues, Romeo.<br>
Soon both their lives, and their families lives will be changed forever.<br>
		<br>
It all started with a dance.

    <h2>The Party</h2>
    <p> One night the Capulets threw a party in hope that Juliet and Paris would meet.<br>
      The party went on for several hours, people were dancing and feasting on the buffets.<br>
      <br>
      Romeo and Mercutio decided to sneak into the Capulet party, and they were successful. <br>
      Romeo watched as the crowds circled around each-other dancing in pairs, Juliet did the same from across the room.<br>
      <br>
      At that moment, Romeo caught a glimpse of Juliet. He has never seen anyone as beautiful as her.<br>
      Unknowing that Juliet was part of the Capulet family he walked up to her, and Juliet noticed. <br>
      "Care to dance?" asked Romeo as he held out his hand.<br>
      Juliet smiled accepting his offer and took his hand as they made their way to the center of the ballroom.<br>
      They held onto each-other as they began to dance in each-others arms.<br>
      They couldn't keep their eyes off each-other.<br>
      <br>
      As they continued to dance the Prince Paris noticed this and grew with jealousy.<br>
      He moved closer to him noticing that it was Romeo, a Montague.<br>
      "MONTAGUE!" Paris exclaimed. "TIS ROMEO!" the music went silent.<br>
      <br>
      At this moment Romeo began to run for it letting go of Juliet. Luckily Romeo and Mercutio got away and the party ended.

    <h2>The Balcony</h2>
    <p> As the party ended and everybody was sent home. Juliet was told that she was to be married to Paris in exactly 3 days.<br>
      She did not love Paris, for she had her heart set for another.<br>
      <br>
      She returned to her room weeping light tears as she walked out to her balcony gazing at the night sky.<br>
      Without her knowing, Romeo snuck into the back garden looking for her, he looked up at her balcony and paused hiding behind a bush.<br>
      "For tis be my love, she is so graceful as she gazes in such a way, she must be an angel" he says quietly still gazing at her. <br>
      <br>
      She let out a faint sigh.<br>
      <br>
      "O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? deny thy father and refuse they name, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, and I'll no longer be a Capulet" her tears began to grow heavy as she looked up at the night sky once more.<br>
      <br>
      Romeo emerged from the bushes and said "And I shall no longer be a Montague!"<br>
      <br>
      Startled. Juliet looked down upon the man, "What are you doing here!?"<br>
      "I had to see you again..." Romeo spoke not letting his sight leave Juliet.<br>
      "You could be killed for this my love..." she said.<br>
      "Nothing to worry about my love, I escaped the wicked Prince's grasp" He chuckled. He began to walk towards a vine wall that led to Juliet's balcony, he climbed to the top and their eyes were set on each-other once again.<br>
      Juliet gazed at the man as he stepped onto her balcony, he grabbed her hands gently, intertwining them with his.<br>
      <br>
      They leaned in for a kiss, one that wasn't like any other.<br>
      <br>
      "JULIET!" her father yelled for her.<br>
      <br>
      "You must go before you are caught my love..." Juliet sighed.<br>
      "I shall come back for you once this blows over"<br>
      "You don't understand...I am to be married in 3 days to Paris..."<br>
      "Then let's be wed my love...I shall talk to Friar Lawrence" he kissed her hand once more.<br>
      <br>
      She smiled "I accept"<br>
      <br>
      "JULIET!" her father called again.<br>
      <br>
      "I must go my love" she said.<br>
      <br>
      "Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say goodnight till it be morrow" he kisses her hand one last time for climbing down the vine wall and out of sight.

    <h2>They shall be wed</h2>
    <p> Just as Romeo said, he went to Friar Lawrence seeking guidance and help.<br>
      <br>
      "I am in love Friar..." Romeo said.<br>
      <br>
      "Wonderful news!" Exclaimed Friar, "to whom?"<br>
      <br>
      "To Juliet"<br>
      <br>
      "THE CAPULET!? My boy that is a grave mistake!" Friar warned.<br>
      <br>
      "But I love her Friar, and we wish to me married"<br>
      <br>
      "I warn you my son, this will mean grave danger for the two of you"<br>
      <br>
      "For her...I'd give my life..."<br>
      <br>
      Friar soon agreed to marry Romeo and Juliet, but him mind filled with great worry for the young couple.<br>
      <br>
      The next morning exactly at 9:00 am, Romeo sent for Juliet and they gathered at the church, just the two of them and the Friar.<br>
      No family, no fancy clothes, no rings.<br>
      <br>
      All they had was their love for each-other<br>
      <br>
      They spoke they're vows, intertwining their hands with one another<br>
      <br>
      They soon finished with a kiss, they were now one.<br>
      <br>
      They sat together in the church listening to the sounds of the bells. "There is to be a fight my love..." Juliet sighed.<br>
      <br>
      "How do you know of this?"<br>
      <br>
      "My cousin Tybalt spoke of it..."<br>
      <br>
      "Where is it located?"<br>
      <br>
      "Streets of Verona...you must stop this fight my love..or things will only get worse for us..." She looked at him with worry.<br>
      <br>
      "It shall be done my love.."

    <h2>The Fight</h2>
    <p> Romeo went to the streets of Verona to end the fight.<br>
      <br>
      When he arrived he saw Tybalt with his group, and Mercutio with his own group. <br>
      <br>
      "You said he would be here." Tybalt said. <br>
      <br>
      "And he will" Mercution says as he turns to see Romeo, "See! I told you he'd show up!"<br>
      <br>
      "What's going on?"<br>
      "You." Tybalt said walking towards Romeo, "You were the one dancing with my cousin Juliet"<br>
      <br>
      Romeo froze, thinking of what he can do to stop this fight from continuing.<br>
      "I'm not going to fight you Tybalt"<br>
      <br>
      This shocked Tybalt, "COWARD! FIGHT ME!"<br>
      <br>
      "No" Romeo said standing his ground. Tybalt pulled out his sword.<br>
      <br>
      "STOP!" Mercutio said, "If he won't fight you..." he pulls out his sword "...then I will"<br>
      <br>
      "Wait no Mercutio!"<br>
      <br>
      "ENOUGH!...I accept your challenge" Tybalt said as they both readied their swords.<br>
      <br>
      Tybalt and Mercutio began to swing their swords, missing eachother by inches.<br>
      "Give up Tybalt!" Mercutio said.<br>
      <br>
      "Never!" Tybalt said as they continued to duel.<br>
      <br>
      A few more swings, Tybalt knocked the sword out of Mercutio's hand.<br>
      <br>
      When Mercutio went to retrieve his sword, he looked Romeo right in the eyes as he turned around to face Tybalt, and there was silence.<br>
      <br>
      Tybalt stabbed mercutio right in the abdomen, Mercutio soon fell to the ground, his eyes tracking back to Romeo as his final breathes left his body.<br>
      <br>
      Out of rage, Romeo picked up Mercutio's sword and bolted directly at Tybalt, stabbing him right in the heart.<br>
      Tybalt fell to the ground as Romeo dropped his sword with fear.<br>
      <br>
      He tried to run for it but Tybalt's group already grabbed him and brought him back to the Capulet castle.<br>
      They brought him before Prince Paris.<br>
      <br>
      "He killed Tybalt my sire!" a man said. Paris looked at Romeo and he grinned.<br>
      <br>
      "This is what you get for messing with the Capulets..." he said as Romeo spit in his face, "...Since you show no remourse...I Prince Paris <strong>banish</strong> you from these lands and to never return"<br>
      <br>
      Romeo has a shocked expression spread across his face as he was taken away.<br>

    <h2>Juliet fakes her death</h2>
    <p> Juliet was in her quarters as her lady in waiting was fixing her hair, Juliet had a smile on her face.<br>
      <br>
      "My lady, why are you in such a good mood?" The lady in waiting asked.<br>
      <br>
      "I am in love" Juliet said.<br>
      <br>
      "Ah I see..." as she finishes up her hair and looks in the mirror, "with the lucky Prince Paris I presume?"<br>
      <br>
      "Well..." before she could finish her sentence there was a knock at the door, "Come in!"<br>
      <br>
      It was Friar Lawrence, he had a worried expression spread across his face.<br>
      Juliet noticed this, "you may leave now" she said to the lady in waiting, she took her leave. "What is the matter Friar?"<br>
      <br>
      "Tis Romeo my lady..."<br>
      <br>
      "What happened?"<br>
      <br>
      "He was banished..." Friar looked down.<br>
      <br>
      "Whatever was the reason Friar!?" she asked in a panicked tone.<br>
      <br>
      "He killed Tybalt..."<br>
      <br>
      Juliet's expression changed, tears began to fill her eyes. "It isn't true...tell me it isn't true!"<br>
      <br>
      "It's the truth my lady..."<br>
      <br>
      "Is there anything we can do!?...I am to be married tomorrow"<br>
      <br>
      "There is one way...a way that could make everyone leave you both alone.."<br>
      <br>
      "What is it?"<br>
      <br>
      "We fake your death...they'll hold a funeral for you, and I shall send for Romeo once everybody has left"<br>
		Friar said looking at Juliet.<br>
      <br>
      They both agreed, and the plan worked perfectly.<br>
	  Friar gave Juliet this "poison" that would make her look dead, but really she was asleep.<br>
      As according to plan, the Capulets help a funeral in Juliet's honor.<br>
      <br>
      Friar began to search for Romeo to tell him the plan.<br>
	  But without Friar's knowing. <br>
	  Another one of Romeo's friends were on their way to warn Romeo of what happened.<br>
      The friend beat Friar to Romeo and told Romeo that Juliet was dead, not what actually was going on.<br>
      <br>
      "What do you mean she's dead!?" Romeo said.<br>
      <br>
      "No one knows how! but her funeral was this morning.."<br>
      <br>
      Romeo dashed to where Juliet was located unknowing that she wasn't actually dead.<br>

    <h2>Till death do us part</h2>
    <p> Romeo arrived to where Juliet's funeral was held, he walked up to her casket and looked at her.<br>
      <br>
      "I am so sorry my love, I should've been there.." he said grabbing her hand.<br>
      <br>
      Juliet layed there looking faint and gone. No sign of life.<br>
      <br>
      "My love..." He pulls out a bottle of poison.<br>
      <br>
      "If we can't be together here..." He opens the bottle, "Then I shall see you in the next lifetime my love"<br>
      <br>
      He kisses her one last time then drinks the bottle of poison, every last drop.<br>
      <br>
      Romeo falls next to Juliet still holding her hand as he passes.<br>
      <br>
      Juliet wakes up because of the kiss and sits up excited to see Romeo, but as she turned to her side to see Romeo laying next to her, poison bottle in hand.<br>
      <br>
      Her heart sank.<br>
      <br>
      "ROMEO!?" Juliet yelled beginning to tear up as she looks at him gripping his hand.<br>
      <br>
      "No no no! This wasn't supposed to happen!" her tears flow down her cheeks.<br>
      <br>
      Friar ran inside to see Juliet weeping holding Romeo's hand tight, "No..."<br>
      <br>
      Juliet turned to Friar, "HOW DID THIS HAPPEN!?" Juliet cried.<br>
      <br>
      "Someone beat me to him my lady..." He looked at Romeo then back at Juliet, "If we hurry we can get you away before the prince gets here"<br>
      <br>
      "Leave me be!" She looked back at Romeo, "...let them see me"<br>
      <br>
      "You don't understand Juliet!" Friar yelled.<br>
      <br>
      "I understand completly!...I loved him Friar!..now he's gone.."<br>
      <br>
      Friar stayed silent looking at Juliet.<br>
      <br>
      Juliet continued to cry as she thought, "I wonder if any poison does thy lie upon his lips.."<br>
      <br>
      She leaned in and kissed him.<br>
      <br>
      Friar heard steps coming down to the catacombs, "THEIR COMING!"<br>
      <br>
      The poison wasn't working fast enought.<br>
      <br>
      Juliet stopped and eyed Romeo's dagger, she grabs it and held it to her heart.<br>
      <br>
      "I shall see you soon my love..."she said piercing her heart.<br>
      <br>
      Now both Romeo and Juliet lie there together, for eternal rest still holding onto eachother hands.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>The End</strong> </p>
